# Media Map Angular Client

Deployed on [Heroku](https://media-map-public-mw.herokuapp.com/)

Built for the purpose of learning Angular as well utilizing the Google Maps Javascript API at the request of a client. This repo in particular is the public facing website that is only concerned with READ operations. The primary user has access to a private React frontend website that allows them to interface with the other CRUD operations.
